## Vagrantfile for spinning up VMs for training purposes

This is used in our trainings / workshops to quickly provide virtual machines
to the students that have a reproducible state.
VMs are running on the computer of the teacher or another spare computer so the
students can connect to them via ssh.

The VMs can be accessed using ssh vagrant@<ip> with password "vagrant" or via rdp
